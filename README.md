Visualizing Sexual Assault at MIT
===================
This project is a data visulaztion of the result from the MIT Sexual Assault Survey. In doing this project I hope to make the 
data easier to understand. I wish to make the data more personal, as these statistics are real. Students from the Institute 
make up these statistic.
